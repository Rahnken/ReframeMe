# Reframe Me

Reframe Me is a comprehensive personal development application designed to foster alignment and focus on an individual's goals across various domains of life, namely physical, emotional, and financial wellness. The core philosophy behind Reframe Me is the belief that small, consistent steps can lead to profound and lasting changes. This is done through a structured framework of 12-week cycles, which breaks down the overwhelming process of goal achievement into manageable segments, encouraging users to set and pursue incremental goals that cumulatively lead to significant shifts in habits and life outcomes over a year.
